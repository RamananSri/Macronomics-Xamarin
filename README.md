Macronomics is an application for calculation of calories and bodyweight tracking. The application is centered around a web API which serves as the backend for different front-end applications. Currently the following repositories have been created under the Macronomics banner: 
* Macronomics-Node: Node.Js web API
* Macronimics-WPF: WPF front-end
* Macronomics-Xamarin: Xamarin front-end for iOS & Android

The projects are developed and maintained by computer science students Daniel & Ramanan.
